AaAaaaaaaand it's updated again. Finally, after 6 months
This update comes with a LOT of improvements/changes. A lot has moved around and been cleaned up.

- Reduced API from 90 lines to 44 lines
- Swapped to mysql2 (requires database)
- Rewrote the upload endpoint (60+ lines to only 20)
- Only require query string with token for profile route
- Dotenv is no more -- all json (not sorry)
- It just works :)
- Removed unused dependencies from project
- File expiry (new config key)
